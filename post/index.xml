      <description>library(tidyverse) library(gt) library(ggrepel) library(ggalt) The 2021 college lacrosse season got flipped upside down when a new face off rule was introduced. For decades people spent hundreds and thousands of dollars on lessons and personal trainers to perfect a specific face off move. Mostly every face-off guy in the game used the “pinch and pop”. To describe this move the player would start on one knee and have his hands in a motorcycle grip on the stick.</description>

While most teams were midway through their season, the question of who would have made it to the Final Four. The Final Four games would have been played on the Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but Coronavirus had other plans. Most people watching would have an educated guess that the ACC powerhouses Syracuse and The University of North Carolina would have been two of the four teams.</description>
